# genai_impact_calculator
Our goal is to create a simple tool that can be used to provide a basic estimate of the environmental impact of using common genAI tools. 


Energy consumption estimates based on:

Chien, A. A., Lin, L., Nguyen, H., Rao, V., Sharma, T., & Wijayawardana, R. (2023, July). Reducing the Carbon Impact of Generative AI Inference (today and in 2035). In Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on sustainable computer systems (pp. 1-7). Found inference dominates emissions, producing 25x more carbon than training GPT-3.

Minimizing carbon emissions by improving water and energy use efficiencies in AI servers: A green cloud computing strategy for sustainable artificial intelligence systems. International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT), 9(9), 1822-1824. Found ChatGPT uses ~2.9 Wh per interaction, 10x more than Google search (0.3 Wh).
Regional carbon intensity: EPA eGRID data, average US grid ~0.45 kg COâ‚‚/kWh

Water usage: Data center cooling studies, ~2.5L per kWh energy consumption

Note: Estimates include data center infrastructure overhead (cooling, networking, redundancy) beyond direct computation.
